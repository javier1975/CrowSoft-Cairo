Today 2017-11-17 my docker postgresql server was empty. None of the databse exists. ( maybe it is because today is a false capicua )
Yesterday I send me a gift ( docker-compose down )
I don't know why but I used to have a docker postgresql container which was always up. I restar my computer and the container
was running. Very convinient. All by magic I don't understand. Sure it was the result of some tutorial I followed when I
created my postgresql docker setup.
I used to do CTRL+C to stop my docker-compose. I became more educated and now I use docker-compose down.
Shit happens.
My database where gone
My magic postgresql container was not running
My docker-compose up created new containers for db and web
No databse here
After three beautiful hours of googleing I learnt two things

1- how to define a volume for an image
2- never use docker-compose down ( kidding )

bellow the command to create a container with a volume for postgresql

	docker run -d --name crowsoftcairo_app-db_1 \
	-v /var/lib/docker/volumes/bf244ebe6dba7909d19407018626e1693e73e685ce689c639a0b383bb4a77d70/_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
	-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=14FeDyAr -p 5432:5432 postgres:9.1

to know the volume of a container:

docker inspect -f '{{ .Mounts }}' containerid

to set the volume in a docker-compose.yml:

    volumes:
      - /var/lib/docker/volumes/bf244ebe6dba7909d19407018626e1693e73e685ce689c639a0b383bb4a77d70/_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

Finally about using docker-compose down. In Cairo if I do CTRL+C, next time it will start faster. Now I can use docker-compose down if I want :D
